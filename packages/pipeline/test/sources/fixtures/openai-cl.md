## September, 2026

### Sep 15

Feature

Added API key creation governance controls at the organization and project levels. Administrators can allow only service-account keys, allow only user-owned project keys, or disable all new API key creation. Organization restrictions take precedence over project settings, and existing API keys are unaffected. See [production best practices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/production-best-practices#api-keys) for details.

### Sep 10

Feature

You can now set expiration dates when creating project API keys. Administrators can also enforce a maximum key lifetime at the organization or project level in Platform settings, requiring newly created keys to expire within the configured limit. See [production best practices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/production-best-practices#api-keys) for guidance on key expiration and rotation.

### Sep 10

Feature

Released the [Agents API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/overview) in public beta. Build agents with a managed Codex harness while OpenAI handles session orchestration, context compaction, and recovery.

Use durable sessions to continue work across turns, stream progress, and connect your own tools and MCP servers. Run agents in OpenAI-hosted sandboxes or connect a sandbox from your own infrastructure or a supported provider.

Start with the [Agents API quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/quickstart).

### Sep 10

Feature · Model: gpt-live-1 · API: v1/live/sessions

[GPT-Live 1](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-live-1) is now generally available in the API. Build full-duplex voice conversations that can continue while a backend model or agent handles reasoning and tools.

Use Responses delegation with an OpenAI model, or client delegation to connect your own backend. Voice sessions cost $0.05 per minute, billed per second; backend model and tool usage is charged separately.

Start with [GPT-Live](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/live), [prompting](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/live-prompting), and [migration guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/live-migration). See [pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing) for details.

### Sep 8

Feature · API: v1/responses

[Prompt Cache Diagnostics](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching/diagnostics) is now generally available in the Responses API for GPT-5.6 and later supported models.

Compare cache reuse against a previous response, identify reasons for cache misses, and follow troubleshooting guidance to improve cache reuse.

### Sep 8

Feature · Model: gpt-image-2.5-sunburst · Model: gpt-image-2.5-flare · API: v1/images · API: v1/responses

Released [GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-image-2.5-sunburst) and [GPT Image 2.5 Flare](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-image-2.5-flare) for image generation and editing through the Image API and the Responses API image generation tool.

Use Sunburst for workflows where editing precision matters most, or Flare for fast, high-quality everyday image generation. Both models support the new `xhigh` and `max` quality settings and use GPT Image 2 token rates. See the [image generation guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation) and [pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing#image-generation).
