# Customize

A fork changes **one file**, `config.yaml`, and optionally one stylesheet, `packages/web/public/custom.css`.
Everything else is code you should not need to touch.

- [How changes take effect](#how-changes-take-effect)
- [Recipes](#recipes): a new topic, a different day, weights, watch lists, companies
- [config.yaml reference](#configyaml-reference): every key
- [Theming](#theming): presets, tokens, `custom.css`, `window.ResonanceTheme`, `data-part` hooks

`config.yaml` is validated when the pipeline starts (`packages/pipeline/src/config.ts`). A typo fails the run
immediately with the exact path of the bad key, never halfway through. `pnpm pipeline doctor` checks it locally.

## How changes take effect

| You change | Takes effect |
|---|---|
| `boards.*` (weights, signal caps, curves, sizes, diversity caps), `site.*`, `retention.days` | **on the whole half-year** at the next run. `/api/v1` is rebuilt from the stored snapshots every time, so history is re-scored consistently. `pnpm publish:data` does it locally without any network. |
| `topic.*`, `sources.*` | on what is **collected from then on**. Off-topic items are dropped before a snapshot is written, so earlier editions keep what they had. |
| `edition.*` | on editions **from then on**. Existing snapshots keep the dates they were filed under. Pick your timezone before the first run. |
| `enrich.*` | next run. Copy is cached by text hash, so switching models does not rewrite existing copy. |
| `mail.*` | the next mail check. These are only defaults, and the `RESONANCE_MAIL` variable wins. |

## Recipes

### Track another topic

The AI-specific parts are the topic filter and the source lists. For a Rust radar, for example, change these keys in
place. Every `sources.*` block must stay in the file, even when you disable it, and remember to replace the journal
feeds too:

```yaml
topic:
  minRelevance: 0.35
  strongKeywords: [rust, rustlang, cargo, tokio, wasm, webassembly]
  weakKeywords: [async, compiler, borrow, crate, memory safety]
  githubTopics: [rust, rust-lang, tokio, wasm, webassembly]
  domains: [rust-lang.org, blog.rust-lang.org, this-week-in-rust.org]
  exclude: []
sources:
  githubTrending: { enabled: true, since: daily, languages: ['', rust] }
  githubSearch:
    enabled: true
    queries: ['created:>{{d-7}} stars:>50 language:rust', 'topic:rust pushed:>{{d-7}} created:>{{d-365}}']
  arxiv: { enabled: true, categories: [cs.PL, cs.SE] }
  reddit: { subreddits: [{ name: rust }, { name: learnrust, weight: 0.6 }] }
  labs: { enabled: false, companies: {} }
```

Then change `site.name` and `site.tagline`. How relevance is scored (0–1, shown on each card):

| Evidence | Points |
|---|---|
| a `strongKeywords` hit (title + description; HN: title only) | 0.6, +0.1 per extra hit (max +0.2) |
| a matching GitHub topic (repos) | 0.5, +0.1 per extra (max +0.2) |
| the link's host is in `domains` (or a subdomain of one) | 0.6 |
| `weakKeywords` hits, only with two of them or next to other evidence | 0.2 each, at most 3 |
| a post in one of your subreddits | a head start of `minRelevance − 0.2`, so one weak keyword or a topical flair is enough |

Papers (they come from your arXiv categories and feeds), lab posts, and X posts of accounts in the `lab` group are on
topic by construction. Keywords match on word boundaries, case-insensitively and with plurals ("LLMs" matches `llm`).
Chinese keywords match as substrings. `exclude` vetoes an item if the term appears anywhere in its key, title,
summary or URL.

### Make "a day" a Beijing day

```yaml
edition:
  timezone: Asia/Shanghai
  cutoff: '00:00'
  settleHours: 8
```

Edition D is then `[D 00:00, D+1 00:00)` Beijing time. `daily.yml` runs every three hours (plus 07:40 and 08:40 UTC),
so a closed edition is published within about three hours of your cutoff. If you want it faster, add a cron line in
your copy of `daily.yml` a few minutes after your cutoff in UTC, e.g. `'40 16 * * *'` for Beijing midnight.

### Re-weight a board

Every board is a list of signals. `weight` is relative (it is divided by the board's total), `cap` is the raw value
that earns full marks, and `curve` shapes the way there:

```yaml
boards:
  news:
    signals:
      - { key: points,    weight: 40, cap: 800, curve: log }
      - { key: comments,  weight: 5,  cap: 400, curve: log }   # care less about flame wars
      - { key: velocity,  weight: 30, cap: 60,  curve: sqrt }  # reward fast risers
      - { key: echo,      weight: 15, cap: 2,   curve: linear }
      - { key: relevance, weight: 10, cap: 1,   curve: linear }
```

Keys must come from the board's catalogue in `packages/pipeline/src/signals.ts`. An unknown key fails the run and lists
the known ones. Drop a line to ignore a signal. The site's **Scoring** page and every score breakdown pick up the new
weights automatically.

### Change the X watch list or the subreddits

```yaml
sources:
  x:
    accounts:
      - { handle: OpenAI, id: '4398626122', group: lab, org: openai }
      - { handle: someone, group: person, weight: 0.8, note: 'why I follow them' }
  reddit:
    subreddits:
      - { name: LocalLLaMA, group: 1, weight: 1.3, flairDeny: [Funny] }
      - { name: ChatGPT, enabled: false }
```

Store the numeric X `id` when you know it, because handles get renamed (`@xai` became `@SpaceXAI`) and ids do not.
Without an id the handle is resolved once and cached. Put giant and small subreddits into different `group`s: each
group is one combined feed, and the giants would otherwise fill all 100 slots.

### Pick AI companies

```yaml
sources:
  labs:
    companies: { anthropic: 1.0, openai: 1.0, deepseek: 1.2, meta: 0 }   # 0 = off
    extraFeeds:
      - { company: nvidia, name: NVIDIA Technical Blog, url: 'https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/feed' }
```

Known company ids (`packages/pipeline/src/sources/labs/sites.ts`): `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `deepseek`, `xai`,
`zhipu`, `kimi`, `qwen`, `meta`, `mistral`, `minimax`. `extraFeeds` adds any RSS/Atom feed under a new or existing
company id. A company known only through `extraFeeds` gets weight 1. To add a company with changelogs, sitemaps or
JSON APIs, see [CONTRIBUTING.md › Add a lab site](../CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-lab-site).

## config.yaml reference

"Default" is the value used when the key is absent. The shipped `config.yaml` may set something else, and that value
is shown in brackets.

### `site`

| `perBoard` | `5` | items per board in the mail body (1–10) |

## Theming

Four layers. Each one only changes values, never structure:

1. **Presets** (`packages/web/src/theme/tokens.css`, `presets.css`): `titanium` (the default: thick lit glass over a
   tactical grid, amber HUD light in dark, industrial grey and safety yellow in light), `paper` (light editorial, serif headlines)
   and `terminal` (mono, square corners), each with a light and a dark mode. Presets only set **colours** (plus
   their type and corner shape); the materials (glass panels, raised plates, recessed wells, glass chrome, HUD lines) are derived from those
   colours, so every preset, and every fork palette, gets the same depth. `docs/VISUAL.md` is the design spec.
   Settings and theme files that still say `aurora` (the old default) load as `titanium`.
2. **Fork defaults** in `config.yaml › site.theme` (`preset`, `accent`). Visitors who have not chosen get these.
3. **Fork stylesheet** `packages/web/public/custom.css`, loaded after the bundled styles.
4. **Visitor settings** (Settings › Appearance): preset, mode (auto/light/dark), accent, density
   (compact/comfortable/cozy), font size (85–130 %), reduce motion, a **custom CSS** box, and theme import/export as
   JSON. The visitor's CSS is injected last.

The state is on `<html>`:

```html
<html data-preset="titanium" data-mode="dark" data-density="comfortable" [data-motion="reduce"]
      style="--font-scale: 1.1; --accent: #e11d48">
```

A pre-paint script (`public/boot.js`) applies it before first paint, so there is no flash of the wrong theme.

### Tokens

Everything visual reads CSS custom properties:

| Group | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Surfaces | `--bg` `--bg-2` (page) `--surface` `--surface-2` `--surface-3` (plates, nested plates, chips) `--well` (recessed fill) `--line` `--line-2` `--scrim` |
| Text | `--text` `--text-2` `--text-3` (≥ 4.5:1 contrast on `--bg` and `--surface` in every preset) |
| Accent and status | `--accent` `--accent-fill` (primary buttons) `--accent-2` `--accent-ink` `--focus` `--ok` `--warn` `--danger` `--info` `--live` `--up` `--down` `--res` |
| Signal | `--signal` (the HUD light: focus ring, active navigation, lit panel edges) `--signal-2` `--signal-line` (signal → signal-2 hairline) `--signal-text` |
| Meaning | `--hue-repos` `--hue-papers` `--hue-news` `--hue-social` `--hue-labs` · `--cat-release` … `--cat-policy` · `--sig-1` … `--sig-8` |
| Materials | `--panel-bg` `--panel-tint` `--panel-edge` `--panel-drop` `--panel-blur` `--rim` (content glass) · `--tint-1` … `--tint-3` · `--plate-bg` `--plate-edge` (raised) · `--well-bg` `--well-edge` (recessed) · `--glass-bg` `--glass-blur` `--glass-edge` (header, tab bar, sheets) · `--elev-0` … `--elev-3` · `--press` · `--thumb-bg` · `--knob` `--knob-shadow` `--switch-off` · `--hl` |
| Glow | `--glow` · `--ring` `--ring-inset` (focus) · `--bloom` (40 % in dark, 0 in light: how much coloured marks glow) |
| HUD | `--hud` `--hud-hot` (HUD line colour at rest / lit: the engaged panel edge, the rim spot) · `--hud-faint` · `--hud-glow` · `--ticks` · `--font-hud` |
| Page | `--spill` (the scene light; `none` turns it off, `--aurora` is its old name) · `--grid` `--grid-dot` `--grid-major` (the tactical grid) · `--scan` `--grain` `--vignette` |
| Type | `--font-ui` `--font-text` `--font-display` `--font-num` `--font-serif` `--font-mono` · `--fs-2xs` … `--fs-3xl` `--fs-rank` · roles `--fs-hero` `--fs-section` `--fs-board` `--fs-item` `--fs-body` `--fs-meta` `--fs-eyebrow` · `--lh` `--font-scale` |
| Shape | `--radius-s` `--radius-m` `--radius-l` `--radius-xl` `--radius-2xl` `--radius-pill` · `--space-1` … `--space-10` `--pad-card` `--density` `--target` |
| Motion | `--ease` (sheet curve) `--ease-pop` (knobs, thumbs) `--ease-in` · `--dur-1` `--dur-2` `--dur-3` |
| Layout | `--header-h` `--tabbar-h` `--tabbar-space` `--maxw` `--gutter` `--z-header` `--z-overlay` `--z-toast` |
| Old names | `--shadow-1` `--shadow-2` (= `--elev-1` / `--elev-2`) `--inset` `--header-bg` (= `--glass-bg`) `--aurora` (= `--spill`): still honoured |

Glow is a budget, not a style: focus, the active navigation item, the live dot, lit HUD lines, score-bar segments and
hue dots (dark mode), full resonance and the "on" switch light up. A fork that wants no glow at all sets `--bloom: 0%`
(marks), `--hud-glow: 0 0 0 transparent` (HUD lines) and `--ring: 0 0 0 2px var(--signal)` (a crisp focus ring
instead of the soft one); a calmer fork can drop the dressing with `--hud: transparent; --scan: none; --grid: none`.

### `custom.css`

Presets set their values on `:root[data-preset='…']`, `:root[data-mode='…']` and
`:root[data-preset='…'][data-mode='…']`. To override a token in **every** preset and mode, use a selector that is at
least as specific. `custom.css` loads later, so it wins the tie:

```css
/* all presets, both modes */
:root[data-preset][data-mode] {
  --radius-m: 4px;
  --hue-labs: #e5484d;
}

/* only paper, only dark */
:root[data-preset='paper'][data-mode='dark'] {
  --bg: #121110;
}

/* one component, through its stable hook */
[data-part='item-card'] {
  box-shadow: none;
}
```

For the accent colour alone, `config.yaml › site.theme.accent` is simpler.

### `window.ResonanceTheme`

For scripts (a bookmarklet, a browser extension, the dev-tools console):

```js
ResonanceTheme.tokens()                                   // current token values
ResonanceTheme.apply({ '--accent': '#e11d48', '--radius-m': '4px' })
ResonanceTheme.reset()                                    // back to the preset and the saved settings
```

### `data-part` hooks

Major elements carry a stable `data-part` attribute. Class names are internal and may change, but these do not:

`app` · `header` · `edition-picker` · `edition-sheet` · `live-toggle` · `search-trigger` · `lang-switch` ·
`mode-switch` · `tabbar` · `offline-banner` · `footer` · `today` · `edition-head` · `brief` · `resonance-strip` ·
`cluster` · `category-bar` · `board` · `runners-up` · `item-card` · `item-meta` · `item-actions` · `rank` ·
`trend-badge` · `score-bar` · `sparkline` · `resonance-mark` · `runner-row` · `status-chip` · `sources` ·
`item-detail` · `item-sheet` · `settings` · `delivery` · `sheet` · `dialog` · `popover` · `toaster` · `toast` ·
`chart` · `empty-state` · `error-state` · `not-found`

Boards and cards also carry `data-board="repos|papers|news|social|labs"`, so one board can be styled on its own.
