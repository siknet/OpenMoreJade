# AI Resonance — Design (v2)

> Daily top-10 AI **repos**, **papers**, **Hacker News stories**, **X + Reddit posts** and **AI-lab updates** — ranked by a
> score you can audit, linked across sources, remembered for half a year, delivered as a site, an interactive report file
> and a scheduled e-mail. No server, no database, no account.

**v2 changes** (supersede anything below that disagrees): five boards (§3a), a fixed edition window (§6a), a shared
category taxonomy (§4a), LLM briefs + essence points (§8.7), interactive HTML reports and scheduled e-mail (§15).

This document is the contract every package is built against. If code and this file disagree, fix one of them
in the same change.

## 1. Product principles

1. **Show the working.** Every rank comes with its score breakdown. An LLM may *write copy*, it never *decides rank*.
2. **Resonance beats volume.** One thing echoing across GitHub + arXiv/HF + HN is the strongest signal we have; surface it first.
3. **Memory.** A day is a row in a half-year table, not a throwaway page: streaks, first-seen, rank history, star curves.
4. **Zero-server, fork-friendly.** GitHub Actions + static files. A fork edits `config.yaml` and owns a radar for any topic.
5. **Bring your own brain.** All AI features run in the visitor's browser with the visitor's keys/endpoints. The site ships no secrets.
6. **One plugin, not a platform.** Four small packages, a handful of runtime deps, no backend, no accounts, no analytics.
7. **Thumb-first and mouse-first.** Every feature must be comfortable at 360 px wide and at 1440 px wide.

Non-goals: comments, user accounts, server-side personalisation, a general RSS reader, chat UI, more than five boards,
posting anything anywhere.

## 2. Architecture

                                                                                │

   BYOK: LLM · search · reader     packages/channels/src/mcp.ts     tools.ts descriptors · digest.md
```

| Package | Role | Runtime deps |
|---|---|---|
| `@resonance/schema` | Data contract: types, entity keys, score maths, date helpers | none |
| `@resonance/pipeline` | The daily job + `serve` (local mode) | yaml, zod, fast-xml-parser, node-html-parser |
| `@resonance/web` | Static PWA | preact, @preact/signals (+ lazy `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) |
| `@resonance/channels` | Everything that *delivers* data: API client, agent tool descriptors, MCP server, dsh seam, **report renderer** (`./report`, DOM-free, also imported by the web app), **e-mail** (`mail` CLI) | @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, zod, nodemailer |

Language: TypeScript everywhere, run natively by Node ≥ 22.18 (type stripping) — hence `erasableSyntaxOnly`
(no enums, no parameter properties, no namespaces) and `.ts` extensions on relative imports.

### 2.1 Source of truth vs derived data

* `data/snapshots/<date>.json` — raw, classified, linked candidates (≤ `retention.candidatesPerBoard` per board).
  **Only snapshots and the LLM copy cache are persisted** (branch `data` in CI, a git-ignored folder locally).
* `/api/v1/**` — *derived*. `publish` regenerates the whole retention window from snapshots + current `config.yaml`
  on every run. Idempotent; changing weights re-scores history consistently; schema migrations are free.
* Several runs per day merge into the same snapshot (latest metrics win).

### 2.2 Pipeline stages (each a module with one exported entry point)

| Stage | Module | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | `http.ts` | `createHttp(opts): Http` — timeout, retry/backoff, per-host min gap, fixture record/replay (`RESONANCE_FIXTURES=record\|replay`, dir `test/fixtures/http`) |
| Sources | `sources/*.ts`, `sources/index.ts` | `createSources(config): Source[]`; a source that throws is reported as `failed` and the run continues |
| Classify | `classify.ts` | `classify(cands, config): RawCandidate[]` — sets `relevance`, drops off-topic; pure |
| Link | `link.ts` | `link(cands, ctx): Promise<RawCandidate[]>` — merges duplicates by key, fills `refs`, may probe READMEs / repo stats for the top few |
| Collect | `collect.ts` | `collect(ctx): Promise<{ candidates, sources }>` — the three above; `edition.ts` then files candidates into editions |
| Store | `store.ts` | `createStore(dir, retentionDays, { candidatesPerBoard }): DataStore` — merges runs, caps each board |
| Score | `score.ts`, `signals.ts` | `rankDay(snapshot, history, config, copy): RankedDay` — pure; `signals.ts` holds the bilingual signal catalogue + `boardMeta(config)` |
| Resonance | `resonance.ts` | pure graph code used by `score.ts` |
| Trend | `trend.ts` | pure; builds `Trend` and `EntityHistory` from the snapshot window |
| Enrich | `enrich.ts` | `enrich(day, ctx, store): Promise<number>` — OpenAI-compatible call, JSON output, cached by text hash; no key ⇒ no-op |
| Pricing | `pricing.ts` | `fetchPricing(ctx): Promise<PricingFile \| null>` |
| Publish | `publish/*.ts` | `publishAll({store, config, outDir, today, pricing}): Promise<PublishReport>` — manifest, daily, latest, weekly, entities, search index, feeds, digests, `llms.txt`; validates every file with zod before writing |
| CLI | `cli.ts` | `run` · `publish` · `serve` · `backfill` · `doctor` |

## 3. Data contract

Defined in `packages/schema/src/api.ts` — read it; it is the spec. Entry point is `manifest.json`.
Entity identity is defined in `keys.ts` and is what makes resonance work: `gh:owner/repo`, `arxiv:<id>`, `hn:<id>`,
`rd:<id>` (Reddit), `x:<id>` (X), `doi:…`, `url:…` (lab posts and any other page).

```
/api/v1/manifest.json                 site meta, dates[], weeks[], live (open edition), board + signal + cap metadata
/api/v1/latest.json                   = daily/<latest>.json
/api/v1/daily/<date>.json             5 boards × (top N + runners-up), edition window, brief, clusters, source status
/api/v1/live.json                     the open (not yet closed) edition, ranked so far — optional, unsettled
/api/v1/weekly/<YYYY-Www>.json        weekly recap
/api/v1/entities/<board>/<YYYY-MM>.json   full history, sharded by first-seen month
/api/v1/search/index.json             compact half-year index for client-side search
/api/v1/pricing.json                  slim model price catalogue (USD / 1M tokens)
/api/v1/digest.md · digest.zh.md      agent-friendly daily digest   · /llms.txt
/api/v1/feed.xml · feed.zh.xml        Atom feeds
/api/v1/report/<date|week>.<lang>.html   self-contained interactive report (§15)
/api/v1/mail-status.json              last e-mail sent / last error (§15.2)
```

### 3a. The five boards

| Board | Question it answers | Sources | Window |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repos` | Which AI repos are builders starring? | GitHub trending + search | edition (star Δ between cutoffs) |
| `papers` | Which new papers are worth reading? | HF daily papers, arXiv, journal feeds | edition (HF list date / arXiv announcement slot — arXiv shows a paper only once announced / undated journal entry: first seen) |
| `news` | What is Hacker News discussing? | Algolia HN | edition (story created time) |
| `social` | What are labs, key people and AI communities saying? | X watch list, AI subreddits | edition (post created time) |
| `labs` | What did AI companies officially ship or publish? | company blogs/news, changelogs, release notes, GitHub releases | **7-day look-back** with freshness decay; posts inside the edition are `fresh` (NEW) |

#### Social and labs sources (decisions from `docs/VERIFIED.md` › v2, which holds the evidence)

* **X** runs in the pipeline only (no CORS). `sources.x.provider`: `xapi` (official pay-per-use: batched
  `GET /2/tweets/search/recent` with `(from:a OR from:b …) -is:retweet -is:reply`, ≤ 512-char queries, `start_time` =
  window start, `since_id` from `data/state/x.json`, `tweet.fields=created_at,public_metrics,conversation_id,referenced_tweets,entities,lang`,
  no `expansions`, read `retweet_count ?? repost_count`), `twitterapi_io`, `socialdata`, `syndication` (free, undocumented,
  fresh only for business-verified org accounts; drop an account whose newest post predates the window). Hard per-run post
  cap + monthly USD soft cap tracked in state; every fetch reports `mode` and `costUsd` in its SourceStatus.
  **Default: enabled, `provider: auto`** — the first paid provider whose secret is set (`X_BEARER_TOKEN` →
  `TWITTERAPI_IO_KEY` → `SOCIALDATA_API_KEY`), else `syndication` for the `lab` accounts only. With X off, the Social
  board still shows Reddit plus `linked` X posts (status links found in HN / Reddit / lab items, resolved free via
  `publish.x.com/oembed`). Store user ids, not handles (handles get renamed).
* **Reddit**: `auto` = OAuth (`client_credentials`, `oauth.reddit.com/r/{sub}/top?t=day&limit=100&raw_json=1`) when
  `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` exist, else RSS (`/r/A+B+C/top/.rss?t=day&limit=100` per size group, ≥ 61 s between requests,
  honour `x-ratelimit-reset`; comments RSS only for the final few posts). Never the unauthenticated `.json` API (403).
  403 with "network security" ⇒ stop, status `failed` + keep the last good Reddit items marked stale (`staleSince`).
  Honest User-Agent (`github-actions:io.github.<owner>.ai-resonance:v<version> (by /u/<name>)`), never a browser UA.
  RSS mode has no votes: `rankBasis: 'position'`, and the `lift` signal uses the post's position in its community list
  (`via: 'rss-position'`). Filters: stickied/AutoModerator/megathreads/NSFW/denied flairs/low ratio dropped; media-only
  posts demoted; crossposts and same-URL posts merged. Reddit is fetched at most every `minIntervalHours` (state file).
* **Labs**: the scraping recipes are **code-owned data** in `packages/pipeline/src/sources/labs/sites.ts` — per company an
  ordered list of strategies (`feed · sitemap · json · payload · mdChangelog · mintlifyUpdates · html · githubReleases ·
  githubNewRepos · hfModels`) with the exact entries from VERIFIED; the first strategy that yields valid items wins, each is
  health-checked. `config.yaml` only picks companies + weights and adds `extraFeeds`. Dating: native instant > day
  precision (noon, publisher tz) > first-seen (`data/state/labs-seen.json`); an item first seen > 7 days after its native
  date is an old post, never "fresh"; the first run only seeds `labs-seen`. De-dupe in three passes (link graph, model/product
  entity token ±3 days, title trigram Jaccard ≥ 0.5 ±2 days); the representative is blog/news > changelog > GitHub/HF and the
  rest become `alsoOn`. x.ai is Cloudflare-protected from runners: fall back to `r.jina.ai` and mark `degraded`.

Boards are data-driven (`BOARDS`, `BoardItemMap`): pipeline stages, validation and UI iterate over `BOARDS` instead of
naming boards, except where board-specific detail is rendered. A board whose sources are all disabled or failed is shown
with an honest empty state and its source status — never hidden silently.

## 4. Transparent heat score

`norm = min(1, curve(raw)/curve(cap))`, `points = norm × weight / Σweight × 100`, `total = Σ points`
(`packages/schema/src/score.ts`). Weights, caps and curves live in `config.yaml`; labels/help text in `signals.ts`;
both are published in `manifest.boards[].signals` so the UI explains the formula without hard-coding it.

| Board | Signals |
|---|---|
| repos | `stars_today` (trending page, else Δ vs previous snapshot) · `momentum` (stars today as % of total) · `hn_echo` · `paper_echo` · `novelty` (1/(1+previous days on board)) · `relevance` |
| papers | `hf_upvotes` · `hf_comments` · `code` (stars of released code, 1 if code exists) · `hn_echo` · `repo_echo` · `recency` · `source_prior` |
| news | `points` · `comments` · `velocity` (points/hour, age floored at 2 h) · `echo` (number of other boards it points into) · `relevance` |

| social | `lift` (engagement vs the author's / community's usual; Reddit RSS mode: position in the community's Top-Today list, `via: rss-position`) · `reach` (X: likes + 2·reposts + 3·quotes + replies · Reddit: score) · `discussion` (replies / comments) · `velocity` · `authority` (watch-list / subreddit weight) · `echo` · `relevance` |
| labs | `kind` (model > product > research > engineering > company) · `release` (+.5 model release, +.2 flagship) · `freshness` (`0.5^(age hours / 24)`) · `echo` (HN points + Reddit score + X likes of items linking to it, HF likes) · `company` (config weight) · `surface` (blog/news .2 · changelog/docs .1 · GitHub/HF 0) |

Exact formulas for the social/labs signals follow `docs/VERIFIED.md` (v2 sections) and are spelled out in `signals.ts` help texts.
Ties break by total desc → primary metric desc → key asc (deterministic output).

### 4a. Categories

Every item gets one `Category` (`release · product · research · tool · engineering · discussion · industry · policy`) from a
rule-based cue classifier (`categorize.ts`: board defaults + title/text cues + source hints such as a lab post's kind or a
Reddit flair). The matched cue is appended to `relevance.reasons` as `cat:<cue>`. The UI offers one category filter bar
that works across all boards. Categories never change scores.

## 5. Resonance

1. Every candidate carries `refs`: keys extracted from its URL, text, HF `githubRepo`, arXiv comment, and (top-K repos only) README.
   News and social items additionally carry the `url:` key of the page they link to (`keysInText` skips `url:` keys, so `link`
   adds `keyFromUrl(linkUrl)` explicitly) — that is how an HN story or a Reddit post resonates with a lab post.
2. Build an undirected graph over today's candidates; edges get a relation: `code` (paper→repo), `paper` (repo→paper), `discussion` (anything→HN story / social post), `mention`
   (a lab post is reached through `mention`; `ResonanceRel` stays unchanged).
3. Connected components with ≥ 2 boards become `ResonanceCluster`s; `strength` = Σ member scores × boards spanned.
4. An item's `resonance.level` = number of distinct boards in its component, capped at 3 ("full resonance"). Level ≥ 2 shows the resonance mark; level 3 is "full resonance".
5. Echo signals feed back into the score *as explicit, visible parts* — never as a hidden multiplier.

## 6. Trend memory (183 days)

From the snapshot window: `firstSeen`, `daysOnBoard`, `streak`, `bestRank`, `prevRank`, badge
(`new` first ever · `back` returned after ≥ 1 day off · `up`/`down`/`same` vs yesterday), a ≤ 30-point sparkline of the
board's primary metric (`stars` / `hfUpvotes` / `points`) and rank history. Full series go to the entity shards.
`prune` deletes snapshots older than `retention.days`; derived files vanish with them on the next publish.

## 6a. Edition window ("what is today?")

* `config.yaml › edition: { timezone: America/Los_Angeles, cutoff: '00:00', settleHours: 8 }`. Edition **D** covers the
  half-open instant range `[D cutoff, D+1 cutoff)` in that timezone — a full US-Pacific calendar day by default; DST days
  are 23 h / 25 h, correctly. A fork may choose `America/New_York`, `Asia/Shanghai`, etc.
* Snapshots are keyed by edition date. Each run fetches with generous source windows (≥ 48 h), then **assigns every
  timestamped candidate to the edition its `createdAt/publishedAt` falls in** and merges it into that edition's snapshot
  (latest metrics win). GitHub repos have no event time: they go to the currently open edition (and, until it settles, also to the edition that just closed — a reading shortly after a cutoff describes that day), and `stars_today` is the
  star count at our last reading in this edition minus our last reading in the previous edition that saw the repo
  (averaged over skipped editions, `via: snapshot-delta`); GitHub's own "stars today" only on a repo's first sighting
  (`via: trending-page`).
* Lifecycle of edition D: **open** (published as `live.json`, `window.to` = now) → **closed** at the cutoff (the first run
  after it publishes `daily/D.json` with `settled: false`) → **settled** (the first run ≥ `settleHours` after the cutoff
  re-reads engagement for D's candidates so late posts get time to be judged, re-ranks, sets `settled: true`). E-mail waits
  for a settled edition unless the user's send time comes first (then it sends what exists, marked "preliminary").
* `run` is idempotent and time-driven: it decides by itself what to (re)build, so the cron stays simple and DST-agnostic
  (`.github/workflows/daily.yml`: every 3 h at :40, plus 07:40 and 08:40 UTC so a run always lands just after a Pacific cutoff).
  `run --date D` pretends now = D's closing cutoff.
* Lifecycle rules (`run.ts`): each source records `settledAt` after its successful settle refresh. Failed, stale and
  cached reads stay pending; subsequent runs may recover them without changing already completed sources' readings
  or observation times. The whole edition becomes settled when all enabled sources have completed. Existing pending
  editions can receive dated recovery candidates for seven days; a current-day fetch without matching historical
  candidates does not falsely complete an older source. An unrecoverable source remains visibly pending.
* A settled edition freezes existing candidates — no new metrics, statuses, clock or run stamps. Genuinely new labs
  look-back posts may still join it, but a repeated lab key cannot rewrite yesterday's likes or score. Lab posts for
  an edition without a snapshot create a labs-only snapshot that feeds the look-back without publishing an edition.
  The open snapshot stores `window.to` = the run time. Pre-existing settled snapshots remain frozen during migration.
* Cold start: `coverage.startedAt` is the first collection instant, `coldStart` flags incomplete initial coverage,
  and `missingBoards` names enabled boards for which historical candidates could not be reconstructed. Rebuilds infer
  this metadata for the first legacy edition collected after its closing cutoff. When only live data exists,
  `latest.json` aliases `live.json`, `manifest.latestKind` is `live`, and `dates` / `weeks` stay empty until a closed
  edition is available; the homepage therefore works immediately without inventing a historical archive.
* Paper dates are explicit: `arxivPublishedAt` is submission time, `arxivAnnouncedAt` is announcement time, and
  `hfSubmittedAt` is the HF Daily curation event. HF curation takes precedence for edition assignment when sources
  merge, independently of which source happens to have richer metadata.
* `labs` ranks over `lookbackDays` (default 7) because official posts are sparse; items outside D are `fresh: false`.

## 7. Web app

Stack: Vite + Preact + @preact/signals + TypeScript. No UI kit, no CSS framework, no chart lib (hand-rolled SVG).
Hash router (works on any static host and sub-path). Budget: **≤ 95 KB gzip** for the initial JS+CSS (raised from 90 KB for the tactical-glass visual layer, docs/VISUAL.md §10).

### 7.1 Information architecture

| Route | View |
|---|---|
| `#/` · `#/d/<date>` | **Today**: brief ("今日要点"), resonance strip, category filter bar, then five boards; a `Live` toggle shows the open edition |
| `#/item/<slug>` | Item detail: score breakdown, resonance links, trend charts, history, one-click summary |
| `#/resonance` | Clusters for the selected day |
| `#/archive` | Calendar heat-map of the retention window → any day |
| `#/weekly/<week>` | Weekly recap |
| `#/search?q=` | Archive search + web search hand-off |
| `#/scoring` | "How scoring works" — rendered from the manifest, with a live calculator |
| `#/settings/<tab>` | General · Models · Credentials · Search · Appearance · **Delivery** (e-mail schedule) · Channels |
| `#/export` | Export an interactive report: this edition · this week · custom range (≤ 31 days), language, boards, include my summaries |

Layout: ≥ 1100 px a front-page grid — row 1 `repos · papers · news`, row 2 `social · labs` (each board a column card),
sticky header, detail opens as a right-hand drawer. Board order and visibility are user settings (hide boards you do not read).
< 1100 px: one board at a time behind a horizontally scrollable board switcher (swipeable), bottom tab bar (Today · Resonance · Archive · Search · Settings),
detail and summary open as bottom sheets. Touch targets ≥ 44 px. No hover-only affordances.

### 7.2 The item card (the core unit)

Rank numeral · trend badge (NEW / ▲3 / ▼1 / BACK, streak "🔥 4d") · title · one-line blurb (pipeline copy in UI language if
present, else source text) · meta row (board-specific: ★ total +today · language / ↑ upvotes · code / ▲ points · 💬 / platform icon · @author or r/community · ♥ · 💬 /
company badge · kind · surface · date; plus a category chip) ·
**score bar**: a segmented horizontal bar, one segment per signal, width ∝ points, colour per signal, total at the end —
tap to expand the full breakdown table (raw → norm → points) · sparkline · resonance mark (linked dots coloured by board) ·
actions: **Summarise ✦**, Search ⌕, Open ↗, Copy link.

### 7.3 Extension seams inside the web app (keep features decoupled)

Source layout (flat on purpose — short paths, one folder per concern):
`src/core` (registry, settings, storage, api client, router) · `src/ui` (primitives) · `src/i18n` · `src/theme` ·
`src/views` (today, item, resonance, archive, weekly, scoring, settings shell) · `src/ai` · `src/vault` · `src/search` · `src/pwa`.

* `src/core/registry.ts` — `registerSettingsTab()`, `registerItemAction()`, `registerCommand()`; features self-register from their `index.ts`. The shell knows nothing about AI/search/theme features.
* `src/core/settings.ts` — one persisted, versioned, zod-free settings object (signals) with `migrate()`; features own a namespaced slice.
* `src/core/storage.ts` — tiny IndexedDB/localStorage wrapper (`kv.get/set/del`, namespaced, quota-safe).
* `src/ui/*` — primitives: Button, IconButton, Field, Input, Select, Switch, Segmented, Tabs, Sheet/Drawer, Dialog, Toast, Tooltip, Skeleton, EmptyState, Markdown (safe subset renderer — **never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with untrusted text**).

## 8. BYOK AI layer (`web/src/ai`)

### 8.1 Providers and models (lightweight model manager)

`Provider = { id, name, kind: 'openai' | 'anthropic', baseUrl, credentialId?, effortStyle, extraHeaders?, extraBody?, models: ModelRef[] }`.
Presets ship for the common hosted providers plus **Ollama** and **LM Studio** (local) and a blank **Custom OpenAI-compatible**.
Per provider: test connection, fetch model list (`GET /models` where CORS allows), add model ids by hand.
Per model: display name, **price** (auto-matched from `pricing.json`, editable override), context size, reasoning-capable flag, default effort.
One model is the *active* model; a quick switcher lives in the summary sheet.

Two adapters cover everything:
* `openai` — `POST {baseUrl}/chat/completions`, SSE, `stream_options.include_usage`; reads `delta.content` and reasoning deltas (`reasoning_content` | `reasoning`).
* `anthropic` — official `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, **dynamically imported** only when an Anthropic provider is used (`dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`), streaming. Follow the current API: adaptive thinking + `output_config.effort`; never send `budget_tokens`/sampling params to models that reject them; handle `stop_reason: "refusal"`.

### 8.2 Thinking effort

UI levels: `default` (send nothing — always available, initial value) · `off` · `minimal` · `low` · `medium` · `high` · `xhigh` · `max`.
Each model stores the subset it allows (auto-filled from `pricing.json › efforts/toggle/budget/alwaysOn`, editable); a chosen
level is clamped to the nearest allowed one. Each provider declares an `effortStyle` that maps the level to request fields
(`packages/web/src/ai/effort.ts`, table-driven, unit-tested):

| `effortStyle` | `off` | level `L` | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | — | — | LM Studio, Mistral, unknown gateways |
| `openai` | `reasoning_effort:"none"` | `reasoning_effort:L` | OpenAI, Gemini-compat, xAI, Groq, Ollama `/v1`, Kimi |
| `deepseek` | `thinking:{type:"disabled"}` | `thinking:{type:"enabled"}, reasoning_effort:L` (L∈low·high·max) | DeepSeek, SiliconFlow DeepSeek/GLM |
| `openrouter` | `reasoning:{effort:"none"}` | `reasoning:{effort:L}` | OpenRouter |
| `qwen` | `enable_thinking:false` | `enable_thinking:true` (+ `thinking_budget` from a level table) | DashScope, SiliconFlow Qwen |
| `thinking-toggle` | `thinking:{type:"disabled"}` | `thinking:{type:"enabled"}` | GLM (BigModel), Kimi k2.x |
| `anthropic-adaptive` | `thinking:{type:"disabled"}` only if the model allows it, else effort `low` | `output_config:{effort:L}` (+ `thinking:{type:"adaptive",display:"summarized"}` when "show thinking" is on) | Claude 4.6+ |
| `anthropic-budget` | omit `thinking` | `thinking:{type:"enabled",budget_tokens:B}`, `max_tokens > B` | Claude Haiku 4.5 and older |

Anything exotic is reachable through the provider's free-form `extraBody` JSON, deep-merged last. Model ids are **never
hard-coded in logic** — presets are editable data and the "fetch models" button is the source of truth.

### 8.3 Pricing

Pipeline republishes a slim `pricing.json` daily. The model manager matches `provider + model id` with normalisation
rules (§13), shows $/1M in/out, and the summary sheet shows **estimated cost before** and **actual cost after** each run
(from streamed usage). Unknown models show "—" and accept a manual price.

### 8.4 One-click summary ("is this worth my time?")

Tap ✦ on any item → sheet opens and streams a **verdict card**:
`TL;DR` (1 sentence) · `Key points` (3) · `Who should care` · `Caveats / maturity` · `Verdict` (Dig in / Bookmark / Skip) + why.
Personalised by an optional "About me / what I care about" note in settings.

Context assembly per board (all browser-side, CORS-verified, each step optional and failure-tolerant):
* repo → metadata in hand + README via `api.github.com/repos/{o}/{r}/readme` (raw), truncated.
* paper → abstract in hand (+ HF page / full text via the configured reader if the user enables "deep read").
* news → article text via the configured **reader** + top HN comments via Algolia `items/<id>`.
Language: follows UI language; a toggle in the sheet overrides per run (and can be pinned in settings).
Results are cached in IndexedDB by `(key, lang, model, depth)`; re-run is explicit. Abortable. Errors are actionable
(CORS → explain relay; 401 → open Credentials; 429 → show retry-after).

### 8.5 Credential centre (`vault`)

One place for every secret: LLM keys, search keys, reader key, GitHub token. `Credential = { id, label, kind, secret, createdAt, lastUsedAt }`.
Storage modes: **session-only** · **device (plain)** · **device (encrypted)** — AES-GCM-256, key from PBKDF2-SHA256 (≥ 310 000 iters)
over a passphrase, unlocked per tab session, auto-lock timer. Secrets are referenced by id everywhere else, shown masked,
never exported by default, never logged, never sent anywhere except the endpoint they belong to. "Wipe everything" button.
A strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`) is set in `index.html`; all external text is rendered as text.
**Trust note** (shown in the UI): on `*.github.io`, project pages of one account share an origin — use your own fork for BYOK and prefer encrypted mode.

### 8.6 Relay (CORS escape hatch)

Setting `relay: 'none' | 'local' | <url>`. `pnpm start` (local mode) serves the built site + API and exposes
`/__relay?url=` on 127.0.0.1 only, restricted to hosts of configured providers. The hosted site never needs it for
CORS-friendly providers; docs list which those are (§13).

## 9. Search (`search`)

One search box (`/` or ⌘K), two scopes:
* **Archive** (default) — client-side over `search/index.json`: tokenised, prefix + CJK substring match, filters (board, date range, min score, resonant only), ranked by match × heat.
* **Web** — hand off the query, or an item's title, to a provider:
  * `redirect` engines (URL templates, no key): Google, Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, GitHub, arXiv, Google Scholar, HN — user picks the default; custom templates allowed.
  * `api` engines (results rendered in-app, reusable as extra context for summaries — "web-grounded summary"): presets verified in §13 plus **Custom JSON API** (URL/method/headers/body templates with `{{query}}`/`{{key}}`, dot-path result mapping) — this is how a local SearXNG or the user's own local API plugs in.
* **Reader** provider for article extraction: default Jina Reader, custom template, or none.

**Out-of-the-box defaults (zero configuration, no keys):**

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Scope when the palette opens | Archive |
| Default web engine | follows UI language: `zh` → **Bing** (reachable from mainland China, good for English tech content), `en` → **Google** |
| Always one tap away | Google · Bing · Baidu (fixed row), plus DuckDuckGo in the overflow |
| Item "⌕ Search this" | contextual engine first — repos → GitHub, papers → arXiv then Google Scholar, news → HN Algolia — then the default engine |
| API engines | none enabled (in-page results and web-grounded summaries appear once the user adds a Tavily / Serper / Bocha / Jina / Firecrawl key or a local SearXNG / custom API) |
| Reader | Jina Reader, keyless |
| Relay | none |

Changing the default engine is one tap in Settings › Search; the user's choice always wins over the language-based default.

## 10. i18n

`en` + `zh`, dictionary modules, `t(key, params)`, first visit = browser language → `site.defaultLang`. Item text shows
pipeline `copy[lang]` when present, original otherwise (with an "original" toggle). Dates/numbers through `Intl`.
Summary language = UI language unless overridden. Adding a language = one dictionary file + `LANGS` entry.

## 11. Appearance & customisation seam

* Design tokens as CSS custom properties (`theme/tokens.css`): colour roles, board hues, signal hues, radius, density, font stacks, motion.
* Presets (`titanium` default: tactical glass with an amber / safety-yellow HUD light, see `docs/VISUAL.md`; `paper` light
  editorial; `terminal` mono) = token maps; light/dark/auto per preset. A stored or configured `aurora` (the retired
  default) is read as `titanium`.
* Fork-level: `config.yaml › site.theme`, and an optional `web/public/custom.css` that is loaded last if present.
* User-level (Settings › Appearance): preset, mode, accent, density, font size, reduce motion, **custom CSS** box, import/export theme JSON.
* Programmatic: `window.ResonanceTheme = { apply(tokens), reset(), tokens() }` and stable `data-part="…"` attributes on major elements, documented in `docs/CUSTOMIZE.md`.

### 8.7 Pipeline copy: essence points and briefs

`enrich` (pipeline, repo owner's key, optional) writes per item `blurb`, `why` and — for top-N items — `points` (2–3 essence
takeaways), in every configured language, plus one `brief` per edition and per week (`headline` + 3–6 bullets citing
`board#rank`). The brief prompt receives only the ranked items (titles, blurbs, scores), so it cannot invent items; bullets
whose citations do not resolve are dropped. All optional: without a key the UI, reports and e-mails fall back to source
text and omit the brief.

## 12. Agent channels (`@resonance/channels`)

* `client.ts` — `createClient({ baseUrl | dir })`: typed readers for every API file (HTTP or filesystem).
* `tools.ts` — framework-agnostic tool descriptors `{ name, description, inputSchema (JSON Schema), execute(args, {signal}) → canonical JSON }`:
  `resonance_today`, `resonance_search`, `resonance_entity`, `resonance_clusters`, `resonance_weekly`, `resonance_digest`.
* `mcp.ts` — stdio MCP server exposing those tools (`RESONANCE_API=https://…/api/v1` or `RESONANCE_DIR=…`).
* `dsh.ts` — the **dsh seam**: re-exports the descriptors in the raw-JSON-Schema `ToolDefinition` shape that dsh's `ctx.tools.register()` accepts, plus a ten-line wiring example in `docs/CHANNELS.md`. Not a dsh plugin; zero dsh dependency.
* Static channels for tool-less agents: `digest.md`, `llms.txt`, Atom feeds.

## 13. Verified external facts

Probed live on 2026-09-19; full evidence, exact URLs, field names and regexes are in **`docs/VERIFIED.md`**. Check
the section for your area before changing an integration. Decisions taken from it:

* **GitHub** — scrape `github.com/trending` (server-rendered; anchor on `article.Box-row`, `h2 a[href]`, `itemprop=programmingLanguage`, `/stargazers`, `/forks`, "N stars today"; expect 15–25 rows, < 5 rows ⇒ `degraded`). Search API: no `OR` between qualifiers; one query per topic; always include the topic-less "fresh & hot" query. Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Actions. Star deltas come from **our own snapshots**; third-party star-history services are unreliable. `api.github.com` and `raw.githubusercontent.com` are CORS-open (README fetch in the browser).
* **Papers** — HF `api/daily_papers?date=` (4-day look-back, weekends empty) is the curated core and the only browser-safe paper API; arXiv Atom API (≥ 3 s between calls, https, descriptive UA) is the metadata backbone; journals via RSS form a low-volume lane that reaches the top only through resonance. Papers with Code is dead. arXiv/Nature/S2 have no CORS ⇒ the browser summarises from the abstract already in the JSON (deep read: `arxiv.org/html/<id>` is CORS-open).
* **Hacker News** — SHOW uses Firebase `showstories.json` plus its first 15 `item/<id>.json` records without source filters; BEST uses Firebase `beststories.json` plus bounded `item/<id>.json` reads. Browser-side comments via Firebase `kids[0..7]` (true rank order), no custom headers.
* **Pricing** — primary `https://models.dev/api.json` (MIT, CORS `*`, includes per-model reasoning control spec), fallback LiteLLM JSON; pipeline republishes a slim allow-listed `pricing.json` and keeps the last good file on failure. Matching rules = `packages/schema/src/pricing.ts`.
* **LLM from the browser** — every probed cloud provider answers CORS preflight correctly ⇒ no proxy needed. Anthropic requires `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` (the SDK's `dangerouslyAllowBrowser`). Local: Ollama needs `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`, LM Studio needs its CORS toggle, Chrome asks for Local-Network-Access permission, Safari/iOS block http loopback from https.
* **Search** — browser-callable APIs: Tavily, Serper, Bocha, Jina Search, Firecrawl, Google CSE (legacy). Need a relay: Brave, Exa, Baidu Qianfan, Kagi. **Bing's API was retired (2025-08-11)** ⇒ Bing and Baidu ship as redirect engines. All API presets are instances of one declarative spec run by one generic runner.
* **Reader** — tiered: text already in our JSON → CORS-open direct fetches (GitHub README, `arxiv.org/html`) → Jina Reader keyless (20 RPM) → Firecrawl/Tavily extract. Truncate client-side.

## 15. Reports and scheduled e-mail

### 15.1 Interactive report file

`packages/channels/src/report/` exports `renderReport(input, opts): string` — **pure, DOM-free, dependency-free**, imported by
the pipeline (hosted report files) and lazily by the web app (the Export view). Output: one `.html` file with inline CSS, a
small inline vanilla-JS controller (≤ 15 KB) and the data embedded as escaped JSON; no external requests, system fonts,
works from `file://` and offline, prints cleanly.

Content: title + edition window · brief · resonance clusters · for each board the top N with rank, title, category, blurb,
**essence points**, why-it-matters, score total (+ breakdown on expand), trend badge, resonance links, source link — and,
when exported from the browser with "include my summaries", the user's cached one-click verdicts.
Interactivity: board tabs + "all" view, category chips, text filter, expand/collapse, language toggle (when both languages
are present), light/dark (auto + toggle), keyboard accessible, mobile-first layout. Weekly reports rank by weekly heat
and show the week's top N per board (N = the board's `size`, not the weekly file's size + runners-up), which keeps a
worst-case five-board week under ~600 KB.

`renderEmail(input, opts): { subject, html, text }` — the e-mail-safe sibling: tables + inline styles, ≤ 640 px, no JS (mail
clients never run it), dark-mode-tolerant colours, brief + top 5 per board with blurb + points + links, a prominent "Open the
interactive report" link (hosted file), and the same report attached as `.html`.

### 15.2 Scheduled e-mail (zero server)

* Sender: GitHub Actions workflow `mail.yml` on a frequent cron; a dependency-free *gate* script decides "due?" and exits
  early otherwise, so most runs cost seconds. Due = now ≥ the user's send time in the user's timezone, frequency matches
  (daily / weekly on a weekday / both), and the idempotency record for that edition or week is absent.
* Non-secret settings live in ONE repository variable `RESONANCE_MAIL` (JSON with the keys of `config.yaml › mail`,
  which supplies the defaults). Secrets: `MAIL_TO` (comma list — a secret so it is masked in public logs), `SMTP_USER` +
  `SMTP_PASS` (QQ/163 授权码, Gmail app password), or `RESEND_API_KEY`. Outlook.com is OAuth-only for SMTP: not offered.
* The web app's **Settings › Delivery** tab does everything from the page with a fine-grained PAT (this repo only;
  Variables, Secrets, Actions read/write) held in the credential vault: `PATCH/POST /actions/variables/RESONANCE_MAIL`;
  secrets via `GET /actions/secrets/public-key` + libsodium **sealed box** encryption (`tweetnacl` + `@noble/hashes` blake2b,
  lazily loaded only by this tab) + `PUT /actions/secrets/{name}` — write-only, the page never stores or reads them back;
  "Send test now" = `POST /actions/workflows/mail.yml/dispatches` with `inputs: { test: 'true' }`; status from
  `mail-status.json`. It also offers the manual alternative (paste values in the GitHub UI) with deep links.
* `mail.yml`: `cron: '7,37 * * * *'` + `workflow_dispatch` (`force`, `test`, `slot`); concurrency group `mail`. A
  dependency-free gate (`packages/channels/src/mail/gate.ts`, Node built-ins only) runs first; only when due does the job
  install and send. Decision rule: enabled → most recent target instant ≤ now in the user's tz (today and yesterday, DST via
  `Intl`) → due while `0 ≤ now − target ≤ graceMinutes` → slot = the newest edition that had closed at the send time
  (daily; the user's local date is not an edition id) or the newest ISO week whose Sunday edition had closed (weekly) —
  it names the hosted report, the Message-ID and the idempotency key (`docs/CHANNELS.md` §6) → skip if
  `state/mail.json` has the slot → require the edition/week to be published (else wait; after the grace window send with a
  "preliminary" banner) → send (3 tries, backoff, deterministic Message-ID `<air-{slot}@{owner}.github.io>`) → write state
  through the Contents API with the file sha (409 ⇒ refetch, merge, retry). `test` bypasses time + state.
* Failures are visible: record `last.error`, open/update a GitHub issue labelled `mail-failure` (the owner is notified),
  exit 1. The pipeline republishes `state/mail.json` (addresses never stored) as `api/v1/mail-status.json`.
* Keep-alive: GitHub disables scheduled workflows in public repos after 60 days without activity, and data-branch bot
  commits are not proven to count — every scheduled workflow calls `gh api -X PUT repos/$REPO/actions/workflows/<file>/enable`
  about weekly. Docs tell users to create their copy with "Use this template" (forks start with Actions disabled).
* The e-mail body stays under ~90 KB (Gmail clips at ~102 KB); the hosted report link is
  `<siteUrl>api/v1/report/<slot>.<lang>.html`; the same file is attached as `ai-resonance-<slot>.html`.
* Provider settings (QQ `smtp.qq.com:465`, 163 `smtp.163.com:465`, Gmail `smtp.gmail.com:465`), limits and evidence: `docs/VERIFIED.md` › v2 › e-mail.

## 14. Quality bar

* `pnpm check` = biome + `tsc` + vitest, green in CI on every push.
* Pipeline: every pure stage unit-tested; one **offline end-to-end test** replays recorded HTTP fixtures through `run` and validates every emitted file.
* Web: unit tests for effort mapping, pricing match, vault crypto round-trip, archive search, safe Markdown, i18n key parity (en ⇄ zh).
* Accessibility: keyboard reachable, visible focus, `prefers-reduced-motion`, contrast ≥ 4.5:1 on text in every preset.
* Failure is visible, not silent: source outages show as a status chip on the day they happened.
